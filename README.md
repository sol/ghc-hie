This library can parse `.hie`-files generated by GHC:
 - 9.12.2
 - 9.12.1
 - 9.10.2
 - 9.10.1
 - 9.8.4
 - 9.8.3
 - 9.8.2
 - 9.8.1

Notes:

`hie_entity_infos :: NameEntityInfo`
 - GHC versions prior to `9.12.1` do not provide `NameEntityInfo` via HIE files.
 - As a consequence `hie_entity_infos` is only available for HIE files that were generated with GHC `9.12.1` or later.
   For HIE files that were generated with earlier versions of GHC `hie_entity_infos` is always `mempty`.
 - It is however still perfectly valid to e.g. use this library with GHC 9.10.1 and read HIE files that were generated with GHC 9.12.2, and even inspecting the `NameEntityInfo` of such HIE files.

Note that **wired-in** names are read as **external** names.  As a consequence
you cannot access the `TyThing` for wired-in names (`wiredInNameTyThing_maybe`
always returns `Nothing`).
