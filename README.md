This library can parse `.hie`-files generated by GHC:
 - 9.12.2
 - 9.12.1
 - 9.10.2
 - 9.10.1
 - 9.8.4
 - 9.8.3
 - 9.8.2
 - 9.8.1

Note that **wired-in** names are read as **external** names.  As a consequence
you cannot access the `TyThing` for wired-in names (`wiredInNameTyThing_maybe`
always returns `Nothing`).
